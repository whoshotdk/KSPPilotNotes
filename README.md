# KSPPilotNotes
A KSP plugin that shows a vessel's description during flight.

This plugin adds a button the the toolbar during flight. Clicking the button will toggle a window that shows the active vessel's description. Useful for noting things like ascent parameters and action groups.

With many thanks to the kind people at IRC channel #kspmodders who helped me overcome some bugs;
