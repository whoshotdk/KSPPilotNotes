# KSPPilotNotes
A KSP plugin that shows a vessel's description during flight. For KSP 1.04.861.

This plugin adds a button the the toolbar during flight. Clicking the button will toggle a window that shows the active vessel's description. Useful for noting things like ascent parameters and action groups.

##Installation

Download and extract the ZIP file, then place the PilotNotes/ folder found in GameData/ into your KSP GameData/ folder.

## Important notes

PilotNotes will only display vessel descriptions for vessels that have an originating .craft file saved to disk.
